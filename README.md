# Cross-Entropy-optmization-
In this code, I try to implement Pointenv, (A pointmass environment in which an agent gets reward for reaching a goal circle.)
And uses the cross-entropy method to try to create a policy that maximizes reward in a PointEnv.
Also, I evaluate multiple plans in the PointEnv environment, using memoization for increased efficiency.
